# 🍽 Gourmet 3D | Fine Dining Experience

**Gourmet 3D** is a next-generation restaurant website that redefines digital dining with immersive 3D visuals, interactive design, and an elegant user experience. This project blends technology and artistry to simulate the luxurious atmosphere of a gourmet restaurant — all through the browser.

## ✨ Inspiration

The idea came from a desire to elevate the typical restaurant website experience. We wanted to go beyond simple images and static menus, creating a visually engaging and immersive platform that captures the *emotion* and *atmosphere* of fine dining. Drawing inspiration from modern 3D web technology, luxury branding, and interactive storytelling, *Gourmet 3D* was born.

- ✅ Parallax-based 3D menu section  
- ✅ Hover-responsive 3D dish cards  
- ✅ Elegant booking/reservation form  
- ✅ Mobile-friendly and fully responsive layout  
- ✅ Stylish gallery with rotating and scaling image cards
